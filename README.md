# RC-Sync-Script
This Google Apps Script project allows you to enter data into a Google Sheet row, choose a template from a dropdown and click a checkbox to automatically generate an invite, fitting your data to any template design. This is a highly customizable high-volume tracking and scheduling tool that allows team-standardization of invite templates that are managerially updatable on the backend.
